# Publish MicroLab with Streamlit Community Cloud

## Deployment settings

- GitHub repository: `Isabelchonggg/microlab`
- Visibility: public
- Branch: `main`
- Main file: `app.py`
- Python: **3.13** (the version used for local verification)
- Preferred app subdomain: `microlab`, if available
- Secrets: none required

This document describes the intended setup; it does not indicate that the
repository or deployment has already been created.

At [Streamlit Community Cloud](https://share.streamlit.io/), sign in with
GitHub, choose **Create app**, then **Yup, I have an app**. Enter the settings
above. In **Advanced settings**, select Python 3.13, then deploy. Complete
GitHub authorisation or any service agreement yourself when prompted. Wait
until the app loads, and copy the actual public URL displayed by Streamlit.
Do not assume the preferred subdomain is available.

## Update from VS Code after publication

1. Edit and save your files.
2. In the project terminal, activate the environment and test:

   ```bash
   source .venv/bin/activate
   python -m pytest -q
   ```

3. Open VS Code's **Source Control** panel. Review the changes, stage only
   intended project files with the **+** buttons, write a short message, then
   choose **Commit** and **Sync Changes**. Sign in to GitHub through VS Code
   if requested; never paste access tokens into chat.
4. Streamlit automatically updates the app from new commits pushed to `main`.
   Dependency changes may take a few minutes. Check the live page afterwards.

Equivalent terminal commands, after reviewing the diff:

```bash
git status
git diff
git add app.py solver.py models.py visualization.py explanations.py styling.py requirements.txt tests .streamlit/config.toml README.md DEPLOYMENT.md .gitignore
git commit -m "Describe your MicroLab update"
git push origin main
```

The first push requires a GitHub remote and authentication. If these have not
been configured, finish repository publication before using the update steps.

## What is published

Only Python source, tests, requirements, documentation, `.gitignore` and the
pink `.streamlit/config.toml` theme belong in the repository. Virtual
environments, caches, `.env` files, private keys and `secrets.toml` are ignored.
Ignore rules do not protect secrets already tracked by Git: review every diff.
No OS-specific packages, local data files, API credentials or local absolute
paths are needed. Cloud installs its own environment from `requirements.txt`.
The SVG mascot is embedded in the source, and Helvetica uses local font
fallbacks without a remote font service.

## Check after deployment

- Open the actual public URL without a signed-in Streamlit session.
- Check the pink theme, tree, eight payoffs and both information sets.
- Reveal a separating PBE and then a pooling PBE.
- In the solver, show the complete solution and Intuitive Criterion proof.
- Submit a Study answer and inspect feedback.
- Apply an Experiment edit and reset the original game.
- Check phone width: tabs and controls remain usable, with no clipped payoffs.
